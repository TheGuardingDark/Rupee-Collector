GAME FUNCTIONALITY
==================


Upon loading the game, players will be met with an instructional banner, background image of Beedle's cave, side scrolls documenting the target score, player score, wins, and losses, as well as four randomly generated rupees with a random secret value assigned to each.

As the player clicks on each rupee, its value is added to their score. They must try to match the target score without going over.

If the player matches the target score, the background is replaced by an image declaring they have won, the wins scroll is increased by one and a new random target number is generated.

The backdrop reappears and four new crystals are generated. The player may play as many times as they like.

If the player's score exceeds the target score, the background is replaced with an image declaring they have lost and the lost scroll is updated. After a few seconds, the background reappears, a new target number is displayed, and four new crystals with four new values are generated. The player may continue to play as long as they like.
